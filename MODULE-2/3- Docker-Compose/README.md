# Make things easier with docker-compose

With docker-compose we save a lot of time trying to manage multiple containers at the same time

All configuration now will be at a single place instead of being spread into multiple commands

## Working with .env files

With docker-compose we can use .env files. This file will help us keep our credentials safe and out from our
docker images or configuration files

A simple example of the content of a .env file could be

```.env
MONGO_ROOT_USERNAME=admin
MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD=admin
```


## RUN your containers with docker-compose

```shell
docker-compose up -d mongo express
```
